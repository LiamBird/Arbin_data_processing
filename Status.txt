Requires text file in format:
Cycle index | Current (any units) | Charge capacity | Discharge capacity | ***Voltage***
(voltage function to be added - no voltage column requirement yet)
Most explanatory comments present (currently missing at end)

Inputs: text file name and path
Outputs: .csv files containing Capacity vs Voltage and Capacity vs Cycles for charge and discharge
             (Capacity vs voltage files columns corresponding to cycles)
